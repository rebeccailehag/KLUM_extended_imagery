## Description
The extended imagery contains 183 images corresponding to 61 samples from KLUM. The images are acquired from three scales (0.2 - 1.2 m). The image names corresponds to the sample index from KLUM (e.g. "A001") and scale (e.g. "_1", "_2" or "_3"). For information about the sample index, please refer to KLUM (https://github.com/rebeccailehag/KLUM_library).
